# Scalable Causal Structure Learning via Amortized Conditional Independence Testing
Implementation of Scalable Causal Structure Learning. 

The datasets currently used in the dataset are not public and we are awaiting confirmation from data owners to share them publically. This repo currently shares the scripts to implement the procedure for a generic dataset alongside instructions for how to run these scripts. An anonymized public repo is currently being maintained that mirrors these files. Upon confirmation that the datasets can be shared publically, we will update this repo with the datasets and additonal instructions for replicating figures.
